# Welcome to the Dev Home repo

This repository contains the source code for:

* [Dev Home](https://aka.ms/devhome)
* Dev Home core widgets

Related repositories include:

* [Dev Home GitHub Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/devhomegithubextension)

## Installing and running Dev Home

> **Note**: Dev Home requires Windows 11 21H2 (build 22000) or later.

### Microsoft Store [Recommended]

Install [Dev Home from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/devhome).
This allows you to always be on the latest version when we release new builds with automatic upgrades.

This is our preferred method.

### Other install methods

#### Via GitHub

For users who are unable to install Dev Home from the Microsoft Store, released builds can be manually downloaded from this repository's [Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/releases).

#### Via Windows Package Manager CLI (aka winget)

[winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) users can download and install the latest Dev Home release by installing the `Microsoft.DevHome` package:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.DevHome -e
```

## Dev Home roadmap

The plan for Dev Home will be posted shortly and will be updated as the project proceeds.

## Dev Home overview

Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code:

### Dashboard

The Dev Home dashboard displays Windows widgets. These widgets are built using the Windows widget platform, which relies on Adaptive Cards.

### Machine configuration

The machine configuration tool utilizes the Dev Home GitHub Extension, but isn't required to clone and install apps. The app installation tool is powered by winget.

#### Popular apps

The machine configuration tool provides a list of popular apps when selecting applications to install. This is currently a hard-coded list of applications that have been popular with developers on Windows. Popularity was determined by high levels of installation and usage. As this is a moment in time, we are not accepting submissions for this list. We're looking to improve the experience with [Suggested Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/devhome/issues/375) so the list can be optimized for developers.

## Developer guidance

* You must be running Windows 11 21H2 (build >= 10.0.22000.0) to run Dev Home
* You must [enable Developer Mode in the Windows Settings app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)

## Building the code

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure your system, please use the [configuration file](.configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml). This can be applied by either:
   * Dev Home's machine configuration tool
   * WinGet configuration. If you have the experimental feature enabled, run `winget configure .configurations/configuration.dsc.yaml` from the project root so relative paths resolve correctly

## Running & debugging

In Visual Studio, you should be able to build and debug Dev Home by hitting <kbd>F5</kbd>. Make sure to select either the "x64" or the "x86" platform and set DevHome as the selected startup project.
